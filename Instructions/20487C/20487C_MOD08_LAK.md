# Module 8: Deploying Services

  Wherever a path to a file starts with [repository root], replace it with the absolute path to the folder in which the 20487 repository resides. 
  For example, if you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487**, change the following path: **[repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod06** to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487C\Mod06**.
