# Module 11: Identity Management and Authorization on Azure Active Directory

>Wherever  you see a path to a file starting with **[repository root]**, replace it with the absolute path to the directory in which the 20487 repository resides. 
> For example, if you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487**, then the following path **[repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod06** will become **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487C\Mod06**.

# Lab: Securing ASP.NET Web API using Azure AD B2C

#### Scenario

The Information Security team has filed a complaint that the BlueYonder application is widely open to anyone who seeks to obtain information about tickets purchased by customers. This poses a big issue for the company and it was decided that the BlueYonder application has to be properly secured.
It was decided to leverage the already existing Microsoft Azure platform to secure the application by using cutting-edge authorization protocols such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. To achieve this kind of security, it was decided to use Azure Active Directory B2C as an identity provider that will host the customer profiles.

#### Objectives

After completing this lab you will be able to:
- Create an Azure AD B2C tenant.
- Link an Azure AD B2C tenant to your primary Microsoft Azure subscription.
- Create Azure AD B2C registered applications.
- Create Azure AD B2C policies.
- Secure ASP.NET Web API applications using Azure AD B2C.
- Consume secured ASP.NET Web API endpoints using a UWP client.


#### Lab Setup
Estimated setup time: 60 minutes.

1. Open Windows Explorer.
2. Go to **[repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod11\LabFiles\Setup**.
3. Run the following command:
   ```batch
    .\createAzureServices.ps1
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions.

### Exercise 1: Creating and configuring an Azure AD B2C tenant

#### Scenario

In this exercise you will create an Azure AD B2C tenant. Then you will link that tenant to your primary Azure subscription. After putting the Azure AD B2C tenant in place, you will proceed to create a registered Azure AD B2C application and configure authentication policies.

#### Task 1: Create Azure AD B2C tenant

1. Open a browser and navigate to the Azure portal.
2. Create a new Azure AD B2C tenant.
3. Link your existing Azure AD B2C tenant to your Azure subscription.

#### Task 2:  Configure an Azure AD B2C tenant

1. Change directory to the new tenant.
2. Create a new application in Azure AD B2C.
3. Create a new policy in the **Sign-up or sign-in policies** tab.
4. Add a new scope with the following information: 
    - Under **SCOPE**, type **read**.
    - Under **DESCRIPTION**, type **read**.
5. Add the new scope **API access**.

#### Task 3:  Configure social logins using Azure AD B2C

1. Open a browser and navigate to the **https://apps.dev.microsoft.com**.
2. Create a new app.
3. Generate a new password for your new application.
4. Add a new Web platform.
    >**Note :** In **Redirect URLs**, type **https://login.microsoftonline.com/te/b2cmod11lab[YourInitials].onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp** (Replace *YourInitials* with your initials).
5. On the Azure protal, create a new identity provider by using the **Microsoft Account** provider.
6. Attach your new provider with the policy that was created in the previews task.
  
   >**Results**: After completing this exercise, you  have the required Azure AD B2C infrastructure in place, configured it and prepared it for integration with the BlueYonder server and client applications.

### Exercise 2: Integrating the BlueYonder server and client applications with Azure AD B2C

#### Scenario

In this exercise, you will configure the BlueYonder Companion Web API and UWP applications to work with the Azure AD B2C tenant created in the previous exercise. The applications will use the Azure AD B2C tenant as their identity provider and allow the user to authenticate against the Azure AD B2C tenant.

#### Task 1:  Integrating the BlueYonder server

1. From the **[repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod11\LabFiles\begin\BlueYonder.Companion** folder, open the **BlueYonder.Companion.sln** solution.
2. From the **BlueYonder.Companion.Host** project, open the **Web.config** file, and add the following code in **\<appSettings\>**:
   ```xml
        <add key="ida:ClientId" value="[Application id]" />  
        <add key="ida:Tenant" value="[Your Tenant Domain Name]" />
        <add key="ida:SignUpSignInPolicyId" value="[SignIn-Policy]" />
        <add key="ida:AadInstance" value="https://login.microsoftonline.com/{0}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration?p={1}" />
   ```
3. Replace the values within the square brackets with the relevant information from the portal.
4. In **BlueYonder.Companion.Host**, open **Startup.Auth.cs**.
5. Add the following code:
   ```cs
        // These values are pulled from web.config
        public static string AadInstance = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:AadInstance"];
        public static string Tenant = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:Tenant"];
        public static string ClientId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:ClientId"];
        public static string SignUpSignInPolicy = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:SignUpSignInPolicyId"];
        public static string DefaultPolicy = SignUpSignInPolicy;
   ```
6. Locate the **ConfigureAuth** method and paste the following code:
   ```cs
         TokenValidationParameters tvps = new TokenValidationParameters
            {
                // Accept only those tokens where the audience of the token is equal to the client ID of this app
                ValidAudience = ClientId,
                AuthenticationType = Startup.DefaultPolicy
            };

            app.UseOAuthBearerAuthentication(new OAuthBearerAuthenticationOptions
            {
                // This SecurityTokenProvider fetches the Azure AD B2C metadata & signing keys from the OpenIDConnect metadata endpoint
                AccessTokenFormat = new JwtFormat(tvps, new OpenIdConnectCachingSecurityTokenProvider(String.Format(AadInstance, Tenant, DefaultPolicy)))
            });
   ```
7. In the **BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers** project, open the **LocationsController.cs** file, and add the **Authorizetion** attribute to the class.
8. Publish **BlueYonder.Companion.Host** to Azure.
9. In the browser, go to the site url + **/Locations** and check whether the response is:
   ```xml
        <Error>
            <Message>Authorization has been denied for this request. </Message>
        </Error>
   ```
#### Task 2: Integrating the BlueYonder native client

1. Open the **[repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod11\LabFiles\begin\BlueYonder.Companion.Client\BlueYonder.Companion.Client.sln** solution.
2. In the **BlueYonder.Companion.Client** project, open **App.xaml.cs** , and then locate the **// TODO: Lab 11, Exercise 2: Task 2.2: Configure Azure B2C sttings.** comment. 

     - Replace the properties' values within the square brackets under the comment with details from the Azure portal.
3. Replace the address used to communicate with the server:
    - In the **BlueYonder.Companion.Shared** project, open the **Addresses** class, in the **BaseUri** property, replace the address of the emulator with the cloud service address you created earlier.  
4. Run the application.
5. Sign in to the app by using the **Microsoft** social provider.
6. Search for a flight, and verify that you get the list of the flights from the server.

   >**Results**: You have integrated the BlueYonder server and client applications with Azure AD B2C, can create users from the UWP client, sign in by using the created user's credentials, edit their profiles, and reset their passwords.
