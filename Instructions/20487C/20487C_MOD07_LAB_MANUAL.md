# Module 7: Windows Azure Service Bus

# Lab: Microsoft Azure Service Bus

## Lab Setup
### Definitions
**[repository root]** = the path where you cloned or download the repository to. E.g. - If your repository resides at C:\Users\JohnDoe\Azure, then substitute every place where it says **[repository root]** with C:\Users\JohnDoe\Azure


First you need to make sure you have an Azure account. If you don't, go to **http://www.azure.com** and register.

1. Under **[repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod07\LabFiles\Setup** you will find a powershell script **createAzureServices.ps1**
2. Execute the script via running **.\createAzureServices.ps1** in the command line.
3. You will be asked to supply a subscription id, you can get it in the following way:
    - Open a browser and navigate to **http://portal.azure.com**, If are prompted to login, do so.
    - In the top bar there is a search box, in it enter "Subscriptions" and press enter. **Cost Management + Billing - Subscriptions** window should open.
    - Under **BILLING ACCOUNT** click **Subscriptions**
    - Under **My subscriptions** you should have at least one subscription. Click it.
    - Copy the value of **Subscription ID** and paste it in the PS prompt.
4. A login window will pop up, fill in your details and log in.
5. The script will create a resource group by the name of **BlueYonder.Lab.07** if it doesn't exist. In that case, you will also have to supply a location for the resource group, just pick the closest location to you.
6. After a minute or 2, the deployment should be done and the script will print out 2 connection strings, one for a SQL server and one for a Notification Hub. You will need them later on.


## Lab Details

#### Scenario

The IT team at Blue Yonder Airlines complained that from the time the company opened its booking services to other companies, they had to make many changes to the network&#39;s firewall in order to open inbound ports. This, of course, limits their ability to secure the company&#39;s internal network properly. To resolve this issue, the company has decided to change the way external applications, including the Travel Companion back-end services, connect to the WCF booking service.  Now all the communication with the on-premises service will be directed through a Azure Service Bus Relay. In this lab, you will create a Service Bus Relay in Azure, configure the WCF booking service to register with the Service Bus, and update the Travel Companion back-end service to send messages to the WCF service through the relay.

In addition, Blue Yonder Airlines wishes to improve the service offered to Travel Companion users by sending users&#39; updated information about changes made to their booked flights directly to their client app. To provide immediate feedback to the end user who updates the flight schedules, it was decided that the notifications will not be sent during the update process but rather be sent by a background process. To interact with the background process, the ASP.NET Web API service will use Service Bus Queues, and the background process itself will run in an Azure Function. For the notifications, the azure function will use Windows Push Notification Services (WNS).

In this lab, you will update the ASP.NET Web API services to use Azure Service Bus Queues, and create a new Azure Function to perform background processing.

#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Use Microsoft Azure Service Bus Relays.
- Use Azure Service Bus Queues.

### Exercise 1: Using a Service Bus Relay for the WCF Booking Service

#### Scenario

In this exercise, you will create a Service Bus namespace, configure the on-premises WCF Booking service to use a Service Bus Relay, and then configure the ASP.NET Web API services running in Azure to communicate with the on-premises services by using the newly created relay.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create the Service Bus namespace by using the Azure Portal.

2. Add a new WCF Endpoint with a relay binding.

3. Configure the ASP.NET Web API back-end service to use the new relay endpoint.

4. Test the WCF service.

#### Task 1: Create the Service Bus Relay by using the Azure Portal

1. Open the Microsoft Azure portal (**http://portal.azure.com**)
2. Create a new Azure Service Relay named **BlueYonderLab07Relay-YourInitials** (Replace _YourInitials_ with your initials).
    - Select a region closest to your location.
    - Select the newly created Service Bus Relay, click **Shared access policies**, click the **RootManageSharedAccessKey** policy and then copy the primary key to the clipboard.

#### Task 2: Add a new WCF Endpoint with a relay binding

1. Open the **BlueYonder.Server** solution file from the **[repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod07\LabFiles\begin\BlueYonder.Server** folder.
2. Use the Package Manager Console window to install the **4.1.3** version of the **WindowsAzure.ServiceBus** NuGet package in the **BlueYonder.Server.Booking.WebHost** project.

   >**Note:** Other projects in the solution already reference a specific version of the **WindowsAzure.ServiceBus** NuGet package. Therefore, you are required to use the **Package Manager Console** to install the same version of the NuGet package.

3. In the **BlueYonder.Server.Booking.WebHost** project, change the endpoint configuration of the booking service:

    - Open the **Web.config** file
    - Locate the endpoint of the service named **BookingTcp**, and then change its **binding** attribute to **netTcpRelayBinding**.
    - Add an address attribute with the following value: **sb://BlueYonderLab07Relay-YourInitials.servicebus.windows.net/booking** (Replace _YourInitials_ with your initials).

4. Add a new endpoint behavior named **sbTokenProvider** to the endpoint behaviors configuration.

    - Add a new **&lt;endpointBehaviors&gt;** element to the **&lt;behaviors&gt;** element that is under the **&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;** section.
    - In the new **&lt;endpointBehaviors&gt;** element, add a new **&lt;behavior&gt;** element, and set its **name** attribute to **sbTokenProvider**.
    - In the new **&lt;behavior&gt;** element, add a **&lt;transportClientEndpointBehavior&gt;** behavior element to the configuration.
    - In the behavior element add a **&lt;tokenProvider&gt;** element, and in it, add a **&lt;sharedAccessSignature&gt;** element with the **keyName** attribute set to **RootManageSharedAccessKey** and the **key** attribute set to the access key of the new Service Bus you created.

   >**Note:** Visual Studio Intellisense uses built-in schemas to perform validations. Therefore, it will not recognize the **transportClientEndpointBehavior** behavior extension, and will display a warning. Disregard this warning.

5. Locate the endpoint of the service, and then set it to use the new endpoint behavior.

    - Use the **behaviorConfiguration** attribute to connect the endpoint to the endpoint behavior named **sbTokenProvider**.

6. Add an **&lt;applicationInitialization&gt;** element to **&lt;system.webServer&gt;** section group, and then set the initialization page to **/Booking.svc**.

   >**Note:** Application initialization automatically sends requests to specified addresses after the Web application loads. Sending the request to the service will make the service host load and initiate the Service Bus connection.

#### Task 3: Configure the ASP.NET Web API back-end service to use the new relay endpoint

1. Open **BlueYonder.Companion.sln** from **[repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod07\LabFiles\begin\BlueYonder.Server** in a new Visual Studio 2017 instance.
2. Use the **Package Manager Console** window to install the **3.1.1** version of the **WindowsAzure.ServiceBus** NuGet package in the **BlueYonder.Companion.Host** project.
3. Configure the **BlueYonder.Companion.Host** project to consume the new relay endpoint.

    - In the **Web.config** file, locate the **&lt;client&gt;** section within the **&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;** section group.
    - Change the client endpoint configuration to use the **netTcpRelayBinding**
    - Change the client endpoint configuration to use the **netTcpRelayBinding**
    - Set the value of the **address** attribute to the value **sb://BlueYonderServerLab07YourInitialsRelay.servicebus.windows.net/booking** (Replace _YourInitials_ with your initials).

4. Add a new endpoint behavior to the endpoint behaviors configuration.

    - Add a new **&lt;behaviors&gt;** element to the **&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;** section.
    - Add a new **&lt;endpointBehaviors&gt;** element to the **&lt;behaviors&gt;** element.
    - In the new **&lt;endpointBehaviors&gt;**, element add a new **&lt;behavior&gt;** element, and in it, add a **&lt;transportClientEndpointBehavior&gt;** behavior element.
    - In the behavior element add a **&lt;tokenProvider&gt;** element, and in it, add a **&lt;sharedAccessSignate&gt;** element with the **keyName** attribute set to **RootManageSharedAccessKey** and the **key** attribute set to the access key of the new Service Bus you created.

   >**Note:** Visual Studio Intellisense uses built-in schemas to perform validations. Therefore, it will not recognize **transportClientEndpointBehavior** behavior extension, and will display a warning. Disregard this warning.

#### Task 4: Test the WCF service

1. Open the Azure portal (**http://portal.azure.com**)
2. Locate the **BlueYonderLab07Relay-YourInitials** (Replace _YourInitials_ with your initials) Service Bus namespace, and then verify that it contains the **booking** relay.
3. In the **BlueYonder.Companion** solution, bring back the call to the WCF service from the reservation controller.

    - In the **BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers** project, open **ReservationControll.cs** , and then locate the following comment.

      **// TODO: Lab 07, Exercise 1: Task 4.3: Bring back the call to the backend WCF service.**

     You can use the Task List window to locate the **TODO** comment.

    - Uncomment the call to the **CreateReservationOnBackendSystem** method.
4. We will also need to make sure that once the application is published, it also uses the correct database:
    - Open **web.config** under **BlueYonder.Companion.Host**
    - Replace **[Azure SQL connection string]** with the Azure SQL connection string you got from running the setup script in the beginning of the lab.
4. Publish the **BlueYonder.Companion.Host** project:
    - Right click **BlueYonder.Companion.Host** and click **Publish**
    - Select **Microsoft Azure App Service** and select **Create New**
    - Click **Publish**
    - In the **Create App Service** window, under **Resource Group** select an existing group if you have one, otherwise create a new Resource Group.
    - Under **App Service Plan** select a plan if you have one, otherwise create a new service plan.
    - Click **Create**
5. In the **BlueYonder.Server** solution, open the **BookingService.cs** file from the **BlueYonder.BookingService.Implementation** project.
6. Place a breakpoint at the beginning of the **CreateReservation** method, and then start debugging the web application.
7. Open the **[repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod07\LabFiles\begin\BlueYonder.Companion.Client\BlueYonder.Companion.Client.sln** solution file.
9. In the **BlueYonder.Companion.Shared** project, open the **Addresses** class, and then set the **BaseUri** property to the Azure Cloud Service name you noted at the beginning of this lab.
10. Start the client application without debugging, and purchase a new trip to Rome.

    - Use **Search** and start typing **Sea**.
    - Wait for the app to show list of flights from Seattle to Rome.
    - Fill in the reservation form and click **Purchase**.

>**Results**: After completing this exercise, you should have successfully run the client app to book a flight, and have the ASP.NET Web API services, running in the Azure Web Role, communicate with the on-premises WCF services by using Azure Service Bus Relays.

### Exercise 2: Publishing Flight Updates to Clients by using Azure Service Bus Queues

#### Scenario

The Flight Manager Web application supports updating flight schedules with new departure times. In this exercise, you will add the push notifications feature to send flight updates directly to the clients who booked the flight being updated. Sending push notifications to multiple clients can take some time, so the notification part will be decoupled from the ASP.NET Web API service by using Service Bus Queues. In this exercise, you will create a Service Bus Queue and send two types of messages to it from the ASP.NET Web API service: client notification subscription, and flight update messages. In addition, you will create a background process running in an Azure Function, which will receive messages from the queue and act according to each message type by either registering the client with the push notification server, or by sending flight update push notifications to registered clients.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Send flight update messages to the Service Bus Queue.

2. Create a Azure Function that receives messages from a Service Bus Queue.

3. Configure and use Azure NotificationHub to manage subscriptions and distribute notifications.

4. Test the Service Bus Queue with flight update messages.

#### Task 1: Send flight update messages to the Service Bus Queue

1. Open the Microsoft Azure portal (**http://portal.azure.com**)
    - Create a new Service Bus named **BlueYonderLab07ServiceBus-YourInitials** (replace _YourInitials_ with your initials)
    - Open the newly created service bus and Click **Shared Access Policies**.
    - Click the **RootManageSharedAccessKey** policy and then Copy the value of the **Connection string–Primary key** text box.

2. Return to the **BlueYonder.Companion** solution in Visual Studio 2017, and then add the **Connection string** that you copied in the previous step to the **web.config** file.

    - Open **web.config** in located in **BlueYonder.Companion.Host**
    - Add a new entry under **AppSettings**
    - <add key="ServiceBusConnectionString" value="[Connection String from previous step]" />

3. Open the **ServiceBusQueueHelper** class located in the **BlueYonder.Companion.Controllers** project, and then implement the **ConnectToQueue** method.

    1. Use the **ConfigurationManager.AppSettings** to retrieve the connection string.
    2. To create the namespace manager object, use the **CreateFromConnectionString** method of the **NamespaceManager** class.    
    3. Create a Service Bus namespace manager object by using the connection string of the Service Bus.
    4. Check if the Queue exists and create it by using the **CreateQueue** API if necessary.    
    5. Return a new **QueueClient** object for the queue by using the **CreateFromConnectionString** method of the **QueueClient** class.

   >**Note:** The Queue name is stored in a static variable named **QueueName**, and has the value of **FlightUpdatesQueue**

4. In the **FlightsController** class, add a static field for the **QueueClient** object.

    - Call the method you previously created in a static constructor to set the object.

5. In the **Put** method, after saving the changes made to the flight schedule, set the **FlightId** property of the **updatedSchedule** variable to the **id** parameter containing the updated flight id.

    - Create a new **BrokeredMessage** object with the updated schedule as the message body, set the **ContentType** property of the message to **UpdatedSchedule**, and then send the message to the queue.

#### Task 2: Configure BlueYonder's notification hub it to use WNS
We want to be able to notify the clients at real time when a flight changes. To do this, we will use WNS (Windows Notification Service) to send push notifications from the server to the clients.
Before we can send notifications to the clients, we need to know what clients are expecting notifications. Thankfully, we don't have to manage this ourselves and Microsoft Azure provides a service that handles exactly that - Notification Hub.
The Notification Hub itself supports sending push notifications to all kind of platforms, Android, iOS, UWP applications and so on. We will only use its WNS support to send notifications to UWP applications.
During the setup phase for this lab, a notification hub named "BlueYonder07Hub" was created.


1. Open the Microsoft Azure portal (**http://portal.azure.com**)
2. Under **All Resources** pane, find "BlueYonder07Hub", click it to access it.
11. Under **Manage** click **Notification Settings**
12. Click **Windows (WNS)**
13. In **Package SID** field, enter "ms-app://s-1-15-2-4282730232-1326842515-3906499318-170594168-2218672132-3110390429-3067443127"
14. In **Security Key** field, enter "3dl+J0UEuvzdc8ihZilFH+L3DIdCXLKT"
15. Click **Save**

#### Task 3: Create an Azure Function that receives messages from a Service Bus Queue and sends notifications to clients

We are going to create a new **Azure Functions** project. Azure Functions will let us invoke custom logic based on messages that are transferred through the service bus relay we created earlier. We will use WNS to send notifications through the Notification Hub we created earlier.

First we will add a WNS project bundled with the exercise:
1. Right Click the **BlueYonder.Companion** solution.
2. Double click **BlueYonder.Companion.WNS** folder.
3. Select **BlueYonder.Companion.WNS.csproj** and click Ok. Next we will add an Azure Functions project and connect it to the WNS project.
4. Right click the **BlueYonder.Companion** solution.
5. Point to **Add** and click **New Project**
6. Expand **Installed** and then expand **Visual C#**
7. Click **Cloud**

    - BlueYonder.Companion.Entities
    - BlueYonder.Entities
    - BlueYonder.Companion.WNS
    - BlueYonder.DataAccess
    - BlueYonder.Companion.Entities.Mappers
12. Right click the new project you just created.
13. Point to **Add** and click **New Item**
14. Select **Azure Function**
15. Name the function "**PublishFlightUpdate**"
16. Click **OK**
17. A "**New Azure Function - PublishFlightUpdate**" window will open
18. In the list on the left, select **Service Bus Queue trigger**
19. In **Access Rights** select **Manage**
20. In **Connection** enter **ServiceBusConnectionString**
21. In **Queue name** enter "**FlightUpdatesQueue**"
22. Click **Ok**
23. A new file **PublishFlightUpdates.cs** will be added to the **BlueYonder.Companion.Functions** project.
24. Add the following **using** statements:
  ```cs
        using BlueYonder.Companion.Entities;
        using BlueYonder.Entities;
        using BlueYonder.Companion.Entities.Mappers;
  ```
25. Change the signature of the **Run** method to look like this:
```cs
public static void Run([ServiceBusTrigger("FlightUpdatesQueue", AccessRights.Manage, Connection = "ServiceBusConnectionString")]FlightScheduleDTO updatedScheduleDto, TraceWriter log)
```
26. Now add the following line to the **Run** method:
```cs
MessageHandler.Publish(updatedScheduleDto.ToFlightSchedule());
```
27. Next, point to **BlueYonder.Companion.Functions** project and right click it.
28. Point to **Add** and click **Existing Item**
29. Select **MessageHandler.cs** that is located in **[repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod07\LabFiles\Assets\MessageHandler.cs** and click **Ok**

#### Task 4: Publish the new Azure Functions project and configure it
We will first have to publish our Azure Functions project and once it is published, we will need to provide further configuration through the Azure portal, configurations such as various connection strings (Azure SQL, Service Bus, Notification Hub)

First we will publish the Azure Functions project
1. Right click the **BlueYonder.Companion.Functions** project and click **Publish**
2. Select **Azure Functions App**, make sure **Create New** is selected and click **Publish**
3. A new window **Create App Service** will open.
4. In the **App Name** field, enter **BlueYonderFunctions-YourInitials**
