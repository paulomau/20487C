# Module 12: Scaling Services

Wherever you see a path to file starting at [repository root], replace it with the absolute path to the directory in which the 20487 repository resides. e.g. - you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487, then the following path: [repository root]\AllFiles\20487C\Mod01 will become C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487C\Mod01

### Exercise 1: Use Microsoft Azure Redis Cache

#### Task 1: Create an Azure Redis Cache

1. Open the Azure Portal in your web browser. If a page appears, prompting you to provide your email address, enter your email address, and then click **Next**. enter your password, and then click **Sign In**.

2. In the pane on the left side, click **+ Create a resource**, then click **Databases**, and then click **Redis cache**.

3. For the DNS Name and the Resource Group name, enter **blueyondercache-**_YOURINITIALS_.

4. For the pricing tier, choose **Basic C0 (250 MB Cache)**.

5. Click **Create** and wait for the cache to be created. This may take a few minutes.

6. In the pane on the left side, click **All resources**, and then click **blueyondercache-**_YOURINITIALS_ (the Azure Redis cache you created).

7. Click **Access keys** (under **SETTINGS**), and then click the clipboard icon next to the **Primary connection string (StackExchange.Redis)** text field to copy the connection string.

8. Open **Visual Studio 2017**.

9. On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.

10. Go to **[repository root]\Allfiles\20487C\Mod12\LabFiles\begin\BlueYonder.Companion**, select the file **BlueYonder.Companion.sln**, and then click **Open**.

11. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, expand the **BlueYonder.Reservations** project, and double-click the **Web.config** file to open it.

12. Locate the **<connectionStrings>** section, and replace the value of the connection string named **Redis** with the value copied to the clipboard in the previous step. After this step, the **<connectionStrings>** section should be similar to the following:

```
<connectionStrings>
  <add name="TravelCompanion" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" connectionString="Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS;Database=BlueYonder.Companion.Lab12;Integrated Security=SSPI" />
  <add name="Redis" connectionString="blueyondercache-[YOURINITIALS].redis.cache.windows.net:6380,password=YOURPASSWORD,ssl=True,abortConnect=False" />
</connectionStrings>
```

13. To save the file, press **Ctrl+S**.

#### Task 2: Add code to cache the list of latest reservations

1. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, expand the **BlueYonder.Reservations** project, expand the **Controllers** folder, and then double-click the **ReservationsController.cs** file to open it.

2. Locate the **Get** method, and in the method locate the **// TODO: Lab 12, Exercise 1, Task 1.2 : Store the query results in Redis** comment. Place the following code after the comment:

```cs
RedisProvider.Cache.StringSet(RESERVATIONS_KEY, JsonConvert.SerializeObject(reservations));
```

3. To save the file, press **Ctrl+S**.

#### Task 3: Add code to fetch the list of latest reservations

1. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, expand the **BlueYonder.Reservations** project, expand the **Controllers** folder, and then double-click the **ReservationsController.cs** file to open it.

2. Locate the **Get** method, and in the method locate the **// TODO: Lab 12, Exercise 1, Task 1.3 : Fetch the query results from Redis** comment. Place the following code after the comment:

```cs
string cachedReservations = RedisProvider.Cache.StringGet(RESERVATIONS_KEY);
if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(cachedReservations))
{
	return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<List<ReservationDTO>>(cachedReservations);
}
```

3. To save the file, press **Ctrl+S**.

#### Task 4: Add code to invalidate the list of latest reservations

1. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, expand the **BlueYonder.Reservations** project, expand the **Controllers** folder, and then double-click the **ReservationsController.cs** file to open it.

2. Locate the **Get** method, and in the method locate the **// TODO: Lab 12, Exercise 1, Task 1.4 : Delete the cached results from Redis** comment. Place the following code after the comment:

```cs
RedisProvider.Cache.KeyDelete(RESERVATIONS_KEY);
```

3. To save the file, press **Ctrl+S**.

#### Task 5: Test using Windows PowerShell

1. To build the solution, press **Ctrl+Shift+B**.

2. In **Solution Explorer** pane, right-click the **BlueYonder.Reservations** project, and then click **Set as startup project**.

3. To run the application, press **Ctrl+F5**. A browser window opens with the application's landing page. 

4. To see the list of reservations displayed in JSON format, click **/api/reservations**.

5. On the **Start** menu, type **Windows PowerShell**, and then click **Windows PowerShell**.

6. In the PowerShell window, type the following command and hit ENTER. Note that you need to replace the port number (1791 in this example) with the port number displayed in your web browser window when you ran the application. Close all open windows.

```
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:1791/api/reservations?traveler=David" -Method Post
```

8. In the web browser, refresh the **/api/reservations** page, and make sure you see the new reservation in the JSON document.
9. Close all open windows.

  >**Results**: After completing this exercise, you should have successfully created an Azure Redis Cache, and used it to cache reservation information obtained from the database.
